**Last updated: [February, 2021](https://github.com/AaronDinnage/Licensing/releases/tag/v2021.02)**

This is my collection of Microsoft 365 Licensing Diagrams, updated as product names, feature inclusions, and licensing changes.

You will find PDF, PNG, and SVG versions of the diagrams along with the Visio source files. I've also published the diagrams as a [web site](https://m365maps.com/) with GitHub Pages.

The web site, PDF, and SVG files have links on every feature tile so you can click through for more information!

See [Change Log](https://github.com/AaronDinnage/Licensing/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) for update details.

I am a Microsoft employee but these are not official Microsoft published diagrams. They are a visual representation of the product licensing derived from the official online and partner-facing resources. I have carefully balanced the level of detail to ensure all the notable feature and license items are accounted for, but it is certainly the case that not all features are present in these diagrams. There are just too many to include! So my offer to you is that if you see something missing and believe it should be included please reach out and I will do my best to build it in to a subsequent release.

Please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronDinnage) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarondinnage/) if you'd like to discuss, provide feedback, or request changes / updates.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!

I first started publishing these diagams for free on Twitter back in 2017. All along the way people have asked about how they could pay me back for the work I've done on them. I've certainly put countless hours of my own time into maintaining and developing this collection. In response to that regular request I've finally set up a page on PayPal where [you can donate](https://paypal.me/pools/c/8ww03FCFcP) any amount you please. If I can cover my domain registration and associated costs then I'll be really pleased! So if you've found these diagrams useful and you'd like to give something back then you are welcome to make a donation, but please understand that you're not paying me for future work. I can't promise I'll always be able to keep these up to date, though I will try!

Cheers,

 \- Aaron.
