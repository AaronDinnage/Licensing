This is my collection of Microsoft 365 Licensing Diagrams, updated as product names, feature inclusions, and licensing changes.

You will find PDF and PNG versions of the diagrams along with Visio source files.

The PDF files have links on every tile so you can click through for more information!

To be clear, whilst I am a Microsoft employee, these are not official Microsoft published diagrams. They are a visual representation of the product licensing derived from the official online and partner-facing resources. I have carefully balanced the level of detail to ensure all the notable feature and license items are accounted for, but it is certainly the case that not all features are present in these diagrams. There are just too many to include! So my offer to you is that if you see something missing and believe it should be included please reach out and I will do my best to build it in to a subsequent release.

Please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronDinnage) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarondinnage/) if you'd like to discuss, provide feedback, or request changes / updates.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

 \- Aaron.
