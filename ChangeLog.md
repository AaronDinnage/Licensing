2020 / December:
* Made the note in the readme that these diagrams only cover publicly confirmed license types and do not include retired or off-list license plans. Some customers will have retired SKUs in their Enterprise Agreement and won't find them on these diagrams, they should work with their Microsoft team to understand the differences.

====================================

2020 / May:
* Repackaged "Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance" offerings to add "Insider Risk Management", "Information Protection & Governance", and "Discover & Respond" suites. Note that there is functionality that only resides in the suite SKUs and not inside the individual Office 365, EMS, or Windows 10 SKUs. These are known as "suite only" features. Customers that previously bought Microsoft 365 E5 licenses may need a zero-cost add-on to get suite only features.
* Renamed all F1 license types to F3 and added new "Microsoft 365 F1". Note: there is no Office 365 F1, only F3 now.

* Replaced "Meeting Broadcast" with "Live Events".
* Added "retiring" to "Kaizala Pro" as the capabilities are being merged into Teams over time, leading to the eventual retirement of Kaizala.

* Skype for Business Online links in Enterprise plans now link to the service description to ensure customers have the latest information about the Skype for Business Online end of service: https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/skype-for-business-online-service-description/skype-for-business-online-service-description
* Fixed broken link in "PLC Groups" on Office 365 Education plans: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2016/06/20/professional-learning-community-groups-in-office-365-education/

* Added "Office 365 Cloud App Security" to Office 365 E5 plans. There was some confusion because this was retired as a stand-alone SKU (I.E. you cannot buy it on its own, only as part of Office 365 E5), but I've confirmed it is still part of Office 365 E5.

* Corrected "User Experience Virtualisation" (UE-V) link, previous link was going to Windows Analytics.

"Microsoft Defender ATP" does not use the Windows naming because it grants benefits for usage on 3rd party operating systems (i.e. Mac OS).
* Replaced "Windows Defender Antivirus" link, previous link now redirects to generic Windows page.
* Added "Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP)" to rights not included in "Windows 10 E3 for Microsoft 365 F1", as per Microsoft Product Terms, January 2020.

* Collapsed separate PDF files down to a single file per license map type for simplicity and speed to publish.
* All PNG files are now exported directly from Visio at 300 DPI.
