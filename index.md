## Microsoft 365 Licensing Diagrams
## Work in Progress
### By Aaron Dinnage
**Last updated: December, 2020.**

This is my collection of Microsoft 365 Licensing Diagrams, updated as product names, feature inclusions, and licensing changes.

This web page provides online versions of my diagrams directly in your browser, with clickable links from every tile that lead to more information on any given feature or suite.

#### View individual diagram:
* Microsoft 365 Enterprise:  [Simple](https://aarondinnage.github.io/Licensing/ViewSVG.htm?file=Microsoft%20365%20Enterprise)

You will find PDF and PNG versions of the diagrams along with the Visio source files on [GitHub](https://github.com/AaronDinnage/Licensing/).

Refer to the [Change Log](https://github.com/AaronDinnage/Licensing/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) for update details.

I am a Microsoft employee but these are not official Microsoft published diagrams. They are a visual representation of the product licensing derived from the official online and partner-facing resources. I have carefully balanced the level of detail to ensure all the notable feature and license items are accounted for, but it is certainly the case that not all features are present in these diagrams. There are just too many to include! So my offer to you is that if you see something missing and believe it should be included please reach out and I will do my best to build it in to a subsequent release.

Please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronDinnage) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarondinnage/) if you'd like to discuss, provide feedback, or request changes / updates.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

 \- Aaron.
